# Build Notes

I built this with react since that's what I'm learning now. I only peeked at the css file to figure out how to get the background image to make the hands appear as if they had transparent backgrounds. I was unfamiliar with `mix-blend-mode: multiply;`. Everything else I did on my own which I only mention as an explaination of why it's kind of wacky.
